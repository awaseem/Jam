# Jam

Sweet and simple React component library.

## Getting Started

Simply install Jam via NPM and make sure that React and React-Dom is installed :

```
npm install jam-components --save
```

Then Import the part you'd like to use:

```
Import React from 'react';
Import { Button } from 'jam';
```

## Thank you
